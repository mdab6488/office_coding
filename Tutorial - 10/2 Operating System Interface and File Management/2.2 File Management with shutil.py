# The shutil module offers high-level file operations that simplify common tasks like copying, moving, and archiving filesâ€”essential functionality for web applications that handle user uploads or need to manage static assets.

import shutil

# Copy files (e.g., for backing up user uploads)
shutil.copyfile('data.db', 'archive.db')

# Move files (e.g., reorganizing content)
shutil.move('/build/executables', 'installdir')

# Recursively copy directories (e.g., for staging assets)
shutil.copytree('source_dir', 'backup_dir')

# Remove directory tree (e.g., cleaning temporary files)
shutil.rmtree('temp_dir')

# For web applications, these operations can be used in administrative panels where content managers need to organize files or create backups of important data
