# In Python, errors and exceptions are events that interrupt the normal flow of program execution. For web developers, understanding how to handle these interruptions is crucial for building robust applications that don't crash unexpectedly and can provide meaningful error messages to users. Python distinguishes between two primary types of errors: syntax errors (parsing errors) that prevent code from running at all, and exceptions (runtime errors) that occur during program execution even when the code is syntactically correct 

# When developing web applications, you'll encounter various exceptional situations such as database connection failures, missing files, invalid user input, and external API unavailability. Proper exception handling ensures your application can gracefully manage these situations rather than crashing completely. This guide will provide you with comprehensive examples and practical patterns for effectively working with Python's error handling system in web development contexts.
