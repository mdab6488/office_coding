# Conditional expressions in Django enable row-level conditional logic within database queries, allowing developers to incorporate complex decision-making processes directly in their ORM operations rather than in Python code. These expressions are particularly valuable for:

"""
Annotating querysets with conditional values
Performing conditional aggregations for reporting and analytics
Executing bulk updates based on complex criteria
Filtering records with condition-based logic
"""

# The two primary classes that form the foundation of Django's conditional expressions are Case and When . The When class encapsulates a single condition and its corresponding result, while the Case class evaluates a series of When conditions in order and returns the matching result expression (similar to if...elif...else statements in Python) . These expressions can be used in annotations, aggregations, filters, and updates, and can be combined and nested like other query expressions .
