Django query expressions enable developers to create database-level operations directly within Django ORM queries, allowing for more efficient and powerful database interactions without fetching data into Python. Expressions represent a value or computation that can be used in various query operations including annotations, filters, ordering, and updates. By using expressions, you can leverage the database's computational capabilities while maintaining the advantages of Django's ORM system. This approach leads to better performance by reducing data transfer between the database and application layer and enables more complex queries that would be difficult to implement otherwise .

Query expressions are particularly valuable for:
    Dynamic computations directly in the database
    Conditional logic implementation within queries
    Bulk operations that require field-based computations
    Complex filtering scenarios that involve field comparisons
    Database-agnostic implementation of SQL operations
