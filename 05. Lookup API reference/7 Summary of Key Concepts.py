# Lookup API Components: The Django Lookup API consists of Lookup for comparisons and Transform for value transformations, both following the Query Expression API.

# Registration System: Lookups can be registered at the field class level or field instance level using RegisterLookupMixin.

# Built-in Lookups: Django provides numerous built-in lookups covering exact matches, pattern matching, range queries, and temporal operations.

# Custom Lookups: You can extend Django's query capabilities by implementing custom lookups for specialized requirements.

# Performance Considerations: Custom lookups can be optimized for database performance, such as using range queries instead of function applications.

# Database Compatibility: Custom lookups can accommodate differences between database vendors by generating vendor-specific SQL.
