# The Django Lookup API provides a powerful mechanism for building the WHERE clause of database queries through a structured system of lookups and transformations. Understanding its core components is essential for effective query construction and extension.

# The Lookup API consists of two primary components that work together to enable complex query operations:
# Lookup class: Used for direct field comparisons (e.g., field_name__exact='value')
# Transform class: Used to transform field values before comparison (e.g., field_name__lower='value')

# A typical lookup expression follows this three-part structure:
# FieldComponent__TransformationComponent__LookupComponent

# For example, in author__best_friends__first_name__icontains, "author" represents the field component, "best_friends" represents a relationship traversal, "first_name" is another field component, and "icontains" is the lookup component.
