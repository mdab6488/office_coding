Django models form the foundation of any Django application, serving as the single, definitive source of information about your data. They define the structure and behavior of the data you're storing, with each model typically mapping to a single database table. Models encapsulate the essential fields and behaviors of your data, allowing Django to automatically generate a database-access API that lets you create, retrieve, update, and delete records without writing raw SQL queries .

The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system provides an abstraction layer that lets you work with databases using Python code rather than SQL, making your code more maintainable and database-agnostic. This comprehensive guide will explore every aspect of Django's Model class through practical examples, helping you master model definition, relationships, inheritance, and optimization techniques.
